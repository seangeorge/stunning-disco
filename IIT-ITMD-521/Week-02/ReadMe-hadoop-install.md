# Hadoop Version and JPS

The Hadoop version is found in two ways:

1. A sudo PATH is declared and the hadoop version is found using the command - hadoop version

When you Logout and vagrant ssh again and check the hadoop version, the hadoop version is not displayed. Hence we prefer the second approach.

2. Modify the bashrc, exit and vagrant ssh again. Check the hadoop version now(highlighted in the image below)
